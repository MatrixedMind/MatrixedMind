# MatrixedMind Use Policy

MatrixedMind is open-source and licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.

This document is a human-readable summary of intent.  
It does not replace or modify the license itself.  
If anything here conflicts with the AGPL-3.0-or-later license text, the license takes precedence.

## You May

- Use MatrixedMind for personal, academic, or professional work.  
- Host MatrixedMind for yourself, your team, or your organization.  
- Include MatrixedMind as a component inside a larger system, even if that system is commercial.  
- Offer consulting, deployment, integration, customization, or ongoing support around MatrixedMind.  
- Fork the code, modify it, and redistribute your fork, as long as your fork is also open under AGPL-3.0-or-later.

---

## You Must

- Preserve attribution to MatrixedMind.  
- Keep MatrixedMind and any derivative of MatrixedMind licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later.  
- If you provide MatrixedMind (or a modified version) as a network service to others, you must make the source for that version available to those users.

---

## You May Not

- Take MatrixedMind (or a minor derivative) and sell it as a proprietary, closed-source product.  
- Offer a paid “MatrixedMind-as-a-Service” or “hosted MatrixedMind” where the main value is simply hosting this code, without:

  1. Open access to the modified source.  
  2. Clear disclosure that MatrixedMind is being used.  
  3. Meaningful additional functionality or services beyond basic hosting.

---

## In Plain English

- You can absolutely build cool stuff on top of this.  
- You can absolutely charge money for your added value.  
- You just can’t quietly strip the name off, close the source, and sell it as if it’s yours.  

If you’re unsure whether your intended use fits these guidelines, open a discussion in the repository.  
The maintainers are generally permissive and community-friendly.
